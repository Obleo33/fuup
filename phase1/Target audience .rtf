\f0\fs24 \cf0 We decided that we wanted to make a game-like version of a fitness app. We think that this game can be used by anyone, but will most likely attract men/women between 25-45.

We believe that by making it more of a game with tasks that range from running to mental wellness we could get people to really enjoy exercise.}
